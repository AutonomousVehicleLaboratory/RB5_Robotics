Qualcomm Robotics RB5 is a powerful edge computing device for robotics applications. We create this tutorial website to guide users to setup and run robotics applications on it.

The tutorials can be found at [categories](all-categories). They are devided into four sections: initial setup, accessing devices, robotics applications and ML at the edge. 

For the initial setup tutorials, they will guide you through flashing a system, connecting to wifi and monitor. If you want, you can also follow the tutorial to setup a gnome desktop.

Then the tutorials on accessing devices will allow you to use the cameras and an IMU on Qualcomm Robotics RB5. Your Qualcomm Robotics RB5 can also work with bluetooth joystick controllers if you build and load the kernel modules following the tutorials.

With the sensor access, the robotics application tutorials will teach you how to install ros and demo apriltag feature detection, control of mobile robot platform as well as running ORB-SLAM3 on Qualcomm Robotics RB5.

Finally, the last set of tutorials introduce the process of converting a machine learning model for semantic segmentaion to run on Qualcomm Robotics RB5.
